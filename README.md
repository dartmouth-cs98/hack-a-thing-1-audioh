# Audioh 🔊
A small socketIO application for chat

## Motivation 🏃🏾‍♀️
I originally wanted to make an Electron application that would record audio and analyze the source for any material. However, I ran into a lot of issues with that approach. So decided to move forward with interacting with the laptop's webcam. I was able to do that, and I started to play around with different frame rates and taking snapshots.

After I was done with Electron, I wanted to play around with SocketIO because I've heard a lot about it but I haven't personally used it. So I moved forward with creating my own chat.

I wanted to include image and audio streaming between different users, so I started with images. However, at this moment, stream images among users doesn't currently work, but is something that I'm interested in completing outside of class.
